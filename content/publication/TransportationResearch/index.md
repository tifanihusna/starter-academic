abstract: Mobility is essential for maintaining human well-being, as it aids in accessing basic needs and engaging in social activities. For older adults who drive, driving provides a sense of independence and convenience, allowing them to go wherever and whenever necessary. However, the declining physical condition and cognitive functions of older adults may eventually hinder their ability to drive safely. In Japan, many older drivers prefer to continue driving unless they are officially deemed unfit, reach a certain age, or have someone drive for them. To shed light on the mobility challenges faced by Japan's older adults, we analyzed data from the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) survey using exploratory analysis methods such as multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and nonparametric tests. The results revealed relatively strong relationships between car ownership and self-rated health status, the number of years lived in the current municipality, and the working status of older adults. Furthermore, we identified a higher level of independence, as well as a positive attitude and tendency to give and receive help running errands, among older adults who own at least one car. To assist older drivers in maintaining their mobility and the positive social effects associated with car ownership, this study discusses the potential role of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Specifically, we support the car-sharing business model to lower the financial commitment of older Japanese drivers while providing access to this technology.
