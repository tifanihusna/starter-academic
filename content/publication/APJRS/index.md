  This study examined the effect of cross-district minimum wage differentials on workers’
  commuting probabilities in the pre-pandemic era of the Greater Jakarta Metropolitan
  Area (Jabodetabek). We found that minimum wages in cross-border districts, along
  with differentials between home and neighboring district minimum wages, significantly
  affect worker commuting probabilities. These findings highlighted important
  methodological considerations when analyzing labor survey data, as such data
  typically reflect workers’ residential locations rather than their employment sites.
  Furthermore, labor market policies implemented within specific jurisdictional
  boundaries may generate spillover effects into neighboring labor markets, particularly
  in regions characterized by high mobility. Overall, the evidence indicated that in an
  integrated urban region like Jabodetabek, statutory minimum-wage differences that
  arise directly from district administrative boundaries partly shape formal workers’
  commuting behavior, implying that these jurisdictional divisions and the cross-district
  wage incentives they create should be taken into account in minimum-wage policy
  design and evaluation
