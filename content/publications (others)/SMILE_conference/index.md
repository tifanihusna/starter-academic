abstract: |
  Jakarta has been serving as the capital city of the world’s 4th most populated country in the world, Indonesia, for 75 years.
  Recently, approximately 3 million people from the outskirts of the city commute daily into the city, which already hosts 11 million people.
  The city has been suffering from chronic traffic congestion. Various policy interventions and infrastructural developments have
  been introduced to ease this problem. Since 2014, the Jakarta city government has attempted to transform the city into a smart city.
  We reviewed the literature to examine whether changes had occurred due to the interventions and approaches, and we surveyed
  1000 Jakarta commuters to determine their satisfaction with the transport infrastructure. Descriptive statistics and multiple
  correspondence analysis (MCA) were employed to identify the group of people who were most satisfied or dissatisfied with the
  current public transport facilities. Our analysis results show that there is good satisfaction with public transport operating on
  railways and exclusive lanes. However, there is a lower satisfaction level for public transport operating on regular lanes, possibly
  due to traffic congestion. Public transport operating in regular lanes includes taxis, on-demand car and motorbike-hailing services,
  and cost-free feeder buses. Males and those with high income and high occupation categories (professionals, executives, and
  managers) are particularly concerned about the quality of public transport operating in regular lanes. More efforts should be made
  to address congestion in regular lanes, especially on the routes where feeder vehicles for mass transport are operating, so that
  “seamless transit,” which is the goal of smart mobility in smart Jakarta city, can be achieved.
